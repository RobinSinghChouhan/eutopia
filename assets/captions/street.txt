A concrete version of paradise.
Roads were made for journeys, not destinations.
A great road adventure is measured in friends rather than kilometers.
Any road will take you wherever you want to go. Just pick one and go.
The journey of a thousand miles, begins with a single step.
Keep moving forward and don’t look back.
I’ve always wanted to see what’s at the end of the road.
Ultimately, every road leads to the whole world.
Take only memories, leave only footprints.
Don’t Count The Days. Make The Days Count.
Some beautiful paths can’t be discovered without getting lost.
