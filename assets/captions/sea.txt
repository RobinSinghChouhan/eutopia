Let the sea set you free.
Saltwater cures all wounds.
Sun, Sea, the Sand and ME
Do you sea what I sea?
The waves of the sea help me get back to me.
Smell the sea, Feel the breeze, Hear the ocean, Be at ease
Wild, beautiful, and free; Just like the sea.
You can find me where the sand meets the water.
Let the waves hit your feet & sand be your seat.
The ocean was waving, so I waved back.
I shore do love this view.
