Bloom where you are planted 
To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles
Rich with the spoils of nature 
Lost in the woods.
Let's escape into the forest.
Relax. Refresh. Reconnect.
Be like a tree and let the dead leaves drop
Stay grounded, keep growing, and know when to let go.
Admire the stories the trees tell you
Into the forest I go, to lose my mind and find my soul
There’s no Wi-Fi in the forest, but I promise you’ll find a better connection.
I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees.
