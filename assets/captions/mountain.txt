The best view comes after the hardest climb
Sometimes you just need to change your altitude
Sky above earth below, peach within
I am never lost in the mountains, it is where I find myself
And so the adventure begins
Mountains teach that not everything in this world can be rationally explained
Hike more. Worry Less.
Climbing my way to bigger and better things
Everything is better in the mountains
Thereâ€™s no time to be bored in a world as beautiful as this
