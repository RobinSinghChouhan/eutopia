Let your heart be your compass
Go where you feel most alive
The earth has music for those who listen
Never stop exploring
Escape the ordinary
Wander where the wifi is weak
Somewhere on your journey don’t forget to stop and enjoy the view
There is beauty in simplicity
Go the extra mile, it’s never crowded
Every sunset is an opportunity to reset.
The best thing one can do when it’s raining is to let it rain.
Land really is the best art.
Whatever is good for your soul, do that
Stress less and enjoy the best
All you seed is love
Peace is always beautiful 
I love places that make you realize how tiny you and your problems are
The easy path won’t lead you to the best views
Look for the magic in every moment
Life is better when you’re laughing
When daydreams become reality
Say yes, take risks, and live life on your own terms
The only vacation you’ll ever regret is the one you don’t take
Go to the place where you feel most alive
Wherever you go, leave a trail
Life is about taking chances and having fun
Never settle for just one scoop
Don’t give up on your dreams. Keep sleeping.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
You become what you believe.
Love the life you live. Live the life you love.
